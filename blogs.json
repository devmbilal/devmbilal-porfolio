Here\u2019s how it\u00a0went:</em></p>\n<h3>The Task</h3>\n<p>My iron had stopped working, and it was a growing inconvenience. Rather than procrastinate further, I picked this task as my \u201cfrog\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aa task that I had been avoiding but knew needed to be done. I decided to employ the Pomodoro technique to help me focus and get it done without distractions.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Getting\u00a0Started</h3>\n<p>I set my Pomodoro timer for 25 minutes and got to work. First, I had to figure out how to open the iron without damaging it. I carefully removed the screws and pried it open, revealing a tangle of wires and components. I took a deep breath and dived in, looking for any visible\u00a0faults.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*R1ZD8EcvNvBJ-BCoz23LSw.jpeg\"></figure><h3>Step 2: Staying\u00a0Focused</h3>\n<p>Working with electronics can be daunting, especially when it involves electricity. I knew I had to stay focused, as a lapse in concentration could lead to mistakes or even injury. During each 25-minute session, I stayed committed to identifying the problem. At one point, I got distracted by thoughts of other things I needed to do, but I quickly wrote them down and got back to\u00a0work.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Breaks and\u00a0Rewards</h3>\n<p>After each Pomodoro session, I took a 3\u20135 minute break to clear my mind, stretch, and grab a quick snack. These short breaks helped me recharge without losing momentum. After four Pomodoros, I took a longer break to rest my eyes and stretch my\u00a0legs.</p>\n<h3>Step 4: Finding the\u00a0Fault</h3>\n<p>With renewed focus, I returned to the task and eventually found the fault\u200a\u2014\u200aa loose wire that was preventing the iron from heating up. I carefully reconnected it, ensuring everything was secure. With a little bit of soldering, the iron was back to\u00a0normal!</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BnCNQjBsUVpV78QbNF-SfA.jpeg\"></figure><h3>Lessons Learned</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Was it difficult for you to maintain focus during the activity?</strong><br>Yes, it was a bit challenging to stay focused on a non-software-related task, but the Pomodoro technique helped me manage my attention span effectively.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Did it help you accomplish more of the task than you expected?</strong><br>Absolutely! Not only did I manage to repair the iron, but I also learned a bit about how it\u00a0works.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Do you plan on doing this again regularly, and what will you do to improve the experience?</strong><br>I definitely plan to use this technique again. Next time, I\u2019ll prepare better by having all the tools ready beforehand and perhaps adding some background music to enhance\u00a0focus.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>The Pomodoro technique proved to be an effective strategy to overcome procrastination, even for unexpected tasks like fixing an iron. It helped me stay on track, maintain focus, and ultimately accomplish more than I initially set out to do. If you\u2019re struggling with procrastination, I highly recommend giving it a\u00a0try!</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ff1dd5a5af08\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","content":"\n<p><em>Procrastination is a universal challenge, especially when it comes to tackling those seemingly mundane tasks that we keep putting off.
